# **Introduction**

# **Alpha Factor Finding & Selection**

# **Data Source**

## **Stock Pool**
The original Stock Pool comprises companies listed in the S&P 500 index, representing a broad spectrum of the U.S. stock market.

### Filtered Stock Pool Criteria

The Stock Pool has been refined based on specific criteria to narrow down the selection. The filtering criteria include:

1. **Liquidity**: Companies with sufficient trading volume are preferred, as they tend to have more stable pricing and are easier to buy or sell without significantly impacting the price.

2. **High Risk Factors**:
   - **Delisted Stocks**: Companies that have been delisted from major stock exchanges.
   - **Negative Net Asset Value**: Companies with negative net asset value.
   - **Warning Stocks**: Companies with indicators suggesting potential financial distress or instability.

3. **Long-term Underperformance**:
   Companies that have demonstrated consistent underperformance relative to the broader market over an extended period.
